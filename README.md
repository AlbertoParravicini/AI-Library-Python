# AI-Library-Python

The library contains the general structure used to represent single state and adversarial search problems,
along with a number of algorithms to solve them.

List of the algorithms implemented so far:
  * Minimax
  * Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
  * Negamax
  * Negascout

The library is inspired by the DOSE 2015 project, check it out here: https://github.com/AlbertoParravicini/dose2015_public
